//Description:
//        We are required to build an app that lets patients connect to doctors and book appointments.
//        The day is divided into time slots of 30 mins each, starting from 9 am to 9 pm.
//        Doctors can login to the portal and declare their availability for the given day in terms of slots.
//        Patients can book appointments/ cancel existing appointments.
//        For simplicity you can assume that the doctors’ availability is declared for that particular day only.
//
//        Features:
//        A new doctor should be able to register, and mention his/her speciality among (Cardiologist, Dermatologist, Orthopedic, General Physician)
//        A doctor should be able to declare his/her availability in each slot for the day. For example, the slots will be of 30 mins like 9am-9.30am, 9.30am-10am..
//        Patients should be able to register.
//        Patients should be able to search available slots based on speciality.
//        The slots should be displayed in a ranked fashion. Default ranking strategy should be to rank by start time. But we should be able to plugin more strategies like Doctor’s rating etc in future.
//        Patients should be able to book appointments with a doctor for an available slot.A patient can book multiple appointments in a day.
//        A patient cannot book two appointments with two different doctors in the same time slot.
//        Patients can also cancel an appointment, in which case that slot becomes available for someone else to book.
//        Build a waitlist feature:
//        If the patient wishes to book a slot for a particular doctor that is already booked, then add this patient to the waitlist.
//        If the patient with whom the appointment was booked originally cancels the appointment, then the first in the waitlist gets the appointment.
//        A patient/doctor should be able to view his/her booked appointments for the day.
